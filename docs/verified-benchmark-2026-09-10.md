The benchmark opened a real MCP stdio session, initialized the protocol, discovered both published
tools, and invoked the validation server across four deterministic seeds, two dataset sizes, one
clean scenario, and four controlled defect classes.

## Scope

These figures measure Proofline against its published deterministic benchmark on a GitHub-hosted
runner. They establish reproducibility and behavior for the tested fault model. They do not establish
performance or detection accuracy for arbitrary production pipelines. External geospatial-pipeline
validation is a separate milestone.
